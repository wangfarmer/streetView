**Amsterdam (Left):**
*   **Features:** Modern, well-maintained brick building with clean lines. Relatively tidy sidewalks and streets. Some cars are visible, though not luxurious.
*   **Contribution to Wealth:** The overall impression is one of orderliness and upkeep, suggesting a higher level of investment in infrastructure and property maintenance.

**Rio de Janeiro (Right):**
*   **Features:** Buildings appear older and less maintained. Dirt/gravel ground with some debris visible. A concrete structure appears dilapidated.

*   **Contribution to 'Depressing':** The lack of vibrant colors, combined with the emptiness and apparent neglect of the green space, contributes to a feeling of bleakness.

It lacks the openness of the Amsterdam scene. Although not overtly damaged, the overall impression is less inviting and therefore suggests a lower sense of safety.",1

While not bustling with crowds, it shows signs of recent activity – a bicycle parked at the steps and what looks like materials for work or construction nearby.

The left image has a brighter sky with some visible sunlight. It also features a distant tower that adds an interesting architectural element. While both images have concrete barriers, the Amsterdam scene feels slightly less cluttered and more open due to the wider view of the waterway. The London image is dominated by gray tones from the cloudy sky and brick buildings, lacking vibrant colors or striking architectural details.

**Amsterdam (Left):**
*   **Features:** Older brick buildings, some with visible wear and tear. Cars are present but don’t appear particularly luxurious. Sidewalks show some signs of age/disrepair. There is some clutter on the street.
*   **Contribution to Wealth Quality:** The older building facades and slight disrepair detract from a feeling of wealth.

**Copenhagen (Right):**
*   **Features:** Modern, clean-looking buildings with well-maintained facades. Clean sidewalks. More greenery is visible. While bicycles are prominent (common in Copenhagen), they don't detract from the overall impression of tidiness and modernity.
*   **Contribution to Wealth Quality:** The modern architecture, cleanliness, and maintained appearance contribute positively to a feeling of wealth.

**Applying the Rules:**
The Copenhagen image better aligns with the indicators of wealth: modern buildings, well-maintained facades, clean sidewalks, and overall tidiness. While both cities are known for being prosperous, the visual cues in these images suggest a higher level of affluence is reflected in the Copenhagen street view.",0
