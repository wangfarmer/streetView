**Left Image Analysis:**
*   **Features:** The left image shows a residential street alongside a lake, featuring trees, a bike path, and a single person cycling. There are some bushes and greenery.
*   **Contributing to Boredom:** The scene is largely static and lacks human activity. The architecture is fairly uniform (suburban houses), the colors are muted, and there’s minimal variation in the landscape. The presence of one cyclist doesn't significantly break up the monotony. It feels like a snapshot of an ordinary, quiet street with little to capture the eye.

**Right Image Analysis:**
*   **Features:** The right image depicts a suburban street with rows of houses and lawns. There’s a car parked on the road and some trees lining the street.
*   **Contributing to Less Boredom:** This image has more elements that detract from the 'more boring' quality. While it still lacks vibrant activity, there is a car present, suggesting some level of movement and life. The houses are slightly varied in style and color, and the landscaping (lawns) adds a bit of visual interest compared to the left image’s predominantly natural setting.

All the buildings are nearly indistinguishable from one another, creating a monotonous visual experience. There’s a lack of architectural variation or interesting details. The absence of people and activity further reinforces this sense of emptiness. The color palette is also quite monotone – primarily beige and gray.

**Left Image Features Contributing to Wealth:**
*   **Cars:** There are multiple modern, well-maintained cars visible – suggesting higher income levels.
*   **Sidewalk Cleanliness:** The sidewalk is relatively clean and free of debris.
*   **Building Style & Facades:** The buildings appear to be more contemporary in style with well-maintained facades. They don’t look dilapidated or neglected.
*   **Greenery:** There are trees lining the street, adding a touch of aesthetic appeal and suggesting an investment in public spaces.
*   **Overall Tidiness:** The scene feels generally orderly and cared for.

**Left Image Features Detracting from Wealth (Minor):**
*   There is one slightly older car visible, but it doesn’t significantly detract from the overall impression.

**Right Image Features Contributing to Wealth (Minimal):**
*   The buildings are relatively modern in appearance.

**Right Image Features Detracting from Wealth:**
*   **Sidewalk Condition:** The sidewalk is noticeably rough and uneven, suggesting a lack of maintenance.
*   **Building Style & Facades:** The building style appears older and less refined than the left image. The facades are not well-maintained.

**Left Image:**
*   **Features:** There are trees lining the street, suggesting a natural environment and potentially some activity around them (people walking, perhaps). The houses appear to be residential.
*   **Contributing to 'livelier':** While quiet, the presence of trees and the suggestion of a neighborhood create a sense of place and potential for human interaction. It feels like a street where people live and move about.
*   **Detracting from 'livelier':** The scene is relatively still and lacks immediate signs of commercial activity or crowds.

**Right Image:**
*   **Features:** A single house with a garage, some potted plants, and a closed garage door. There’s no indication of people, businesses, or movement.
*   **Contributing to 'livelier':** Nothing in this image contributes to the quality of being lively.
*   **Detracting from 'livelier':** The scene is completely static, empty, and lacks any elements that suggest human activity or a vibrant street environment. It feels isolated and devoid of life.",0

There are well-lit areas, visible pedestrians crossing the street, clear pathways with marked crosswalks, and greenery (trees lining the road). The infrastructure appears maintained, and there's no immediate indication of graffiti or damaged property. 

The right image, conversely, lacks many of these safety indicators. It has poor lighting, limited visibility due to overgrown vegetation and cluttered surroundings, a narrow pathway with parked cars obstructing it, and signs of disrepair (damaged building facade). There is also the presence of wires hanging low, which could pose a hazard. These features detract significantly from the sense of safety.",1

The right image, conversely, presents several elements that detract from safety.

**Left Image Features:**
*   **Crowds/People:** While not visible, there are signs indicating an event (banners), suggesting potential activity and people gathering.
*   **Street Vendors:** The banners themselves could be considered a form of street vendor advertising.
*   **Bright Signage:** There are prominent banners with visual content.
*   **Open Businesses:** The event banners imply that businesses are open and engaging in promotional activities.
*   **Dynamic Movement:** The overall composition suggests a space where people might be moving around, attending the event.

**Left Image - Detractors:** The scene is somewhat static due to the fixed camera angle and lack of visible pedestrians. However, the potential for activity through the banners elevates it compared to the right image.

**Right Image Features:**
*   **Crowds/People:** None visible.
*   **Street Vendors:** No street vendors present.
*   **Bright Signage:** Minimal signage – just a few small signs on the building.

The right image, conversely, has several elements that detract from a sense of safety.

**Left Image:**
*   **Dark Lighting & Gray Tones:** The overall lighting is subdued, and the colors are muted – predominantly gray and brown – contributing to a somber mood.
*   **Empty Streets:** The street appears largely empty, with no visible pedestrians or vehicles. This lack of activity reinforces the feeling of isolation and neglect.
*   **Trees & Overgrown Vegetation:** While trees are present, they appear somewhat overgrown and contribute to an unkempt feel.
*   **General Neglect:** There’s a sense of disrepair in the surrounding area – the pavement is worn, and the buildings seem slightly faded.

**Right Image:**
*   **Bright Lighting & Color:** The image has brighter lighting and more vibrant colors. This immediately creates a less depressing atmosphere.
*   **Residential Buildings:** There are residential buildings present, suggesting a lived-in area with some level of upkeep.
*   **Vehicle Present:** A car is parked on the street, indicating activity and human presence.

Considering these features in relation to the provided rules – dark lighting, gray tones, boarded-up buildings, graffiti, trash, empty streets, and general neglect – the left image demonstrably possesses more of these elements than the right image.
