**Left Image (Paris):**
*   **Features:** Tall buildings, some cars parked and moving, green spaces with people visible in the distance, wider street.
*   **Contributing Factors to Livliness:** The presence of vehicles suggests activity. The distant figures imply pedestrian traffic. The larger scale of the buildings hints at a denser urban environment.
*   **Detracting Factors:** It's not bustling with crowds; it's more moderately active.

**Right Image (Dublin):**
*   **Features:** Narrower street, older brick buildings, some parked cars, a canal or waterway alongside the road. 
*   **Contributing Factors to Livliness:** The presence of cars suggests activity.
*   **Detracting Factors:** The scene is quite empty and static. The narrow street and lack of visible pedestrians contribute to a quieter atmosphere. The gray skies also make it appear less inviting.

**Applying the Rules:**
The rules emphasize crowds, movement, open businesses, and bright signage. While neither image has all these elements prominently, the left image (Paris) shows more signs of activity with cars and distant figures, making it slightly more lively than the very quiet scene in Dublin.",0

**Left Image (Tokyo):**
*   **Features:** Narrow streets, multiple buildings close together, some signage (though not overly bright), and what appear to be residential or small business structures.

**London (Left):**
*   **Features:** Brick buildings, narrow street, fences/walls, some greenery in the distance.
*   **Contributing Factors:** The brick architecture has some character.
*   **Detracting Factors:** The scene feels cramped and enclosed. There's a lot of gray/brown (brick, pavement), the fencing is utilitarian and not visually appealing, and the lighting is somewhat dim creating a gloomy atmosphere.

**Denver (Right):**
*   **Features:** Houses with varied architecture, trees lining the street, wider road, blue sky, sunlight.
*   **Contributing Factors:** The presence of trees adds vibrant color and life. The wider street and open space create a more inviting feel. Sunlight enhances colors and creates a brighter mood. There's a sense of order and pleasant residential design.
*   **Detracting Factors:** None are immediately apparent; it's a fairly standard, well-maintained suburban street.

**Applying the Rules:** The Denver image better reflects the rules emphasizing vibrant colors (trees, sky), open space (wider road), sunlight, and generally more appealing architectural features. The London image suffers from being cluttered, gray, and lacking in these positive aesthetic qualities.",1

**Chicago (Left):**
*   **Features:** Wider roads, more commercial presence (suggesting economic activity), newer-looking buildings and infrastructure.
*   **Contributing Factors:** The wider road suggests better city planning and investment. Newer buildings indicate recent development or renovation.
*   **Detracting Factors:** Some patches on the road surface are visible, but overall it appears well maintained.

**Dublin (Right):**
*   **Features:** Narrower residential street, older-style houses, more greenery.
*   **Contributing Factors:** Greenery is positive, suggesting a cared-for environment. 
*   **Detracting Factors:** The road surface is visibly damaged and uneven. Buildings appear older and less modernized. The narrower streets suggest a less developed infrastructure.

Considering the rules – modern buildings, well-maintained facades, and overall tidiness – the Chicago side demonstrates these qualities more strongly than the Dublin side.",1

**Left Image (Sydney):**
*   **Features:** Visible cars, well-maintained road markings, some greenery (trees and bushes), buildings with signage, and generally brighter lighting.
*   **Safety Contributions:** The presence of vehicles suggests activity and potential witnesses. Maintained infrastructure indicates a level of care and investment in the area. Brightness contributes to visibility.
*   **Safety Detractions:** Some minor graffiti is visible on the road, but it's not extensive or overwhelming.

**Right Image (Cape Town):**
*   **Features:** Large open grassy areas, a single vehicle, and what appears to be an entrance gate. The area feels more isolated.
*   **Safety Contributions:** The gate could suggest controlled access.
*   **Safety Detractions:** The vast open space with minimal activity creates a sense of isolation. There's less visible infrastructure or signs of regular use. The lighting seems dimmer, and the overall environment appears less maintained.

**Applying the Rules:**

The left image aligns better with the safety indicators: well-lit areas (relatively), visible vehicles, clear pathways, some greenery, and generally maintained infrastructure. The right image lacks many of these features, leaning towards a more isolated and potentially unsafe impression.",1

*   **Safety Detractions:** There's construction equipment visible which could indicate temporary disruption but doesn't necessarily imply unsafety.

**Philadelphia (Right):**
*   **Features:** Narrower street, parked cars obstructing views, less greenery, and buildings appear older/less maintained. The alleyway between the buildings is a potential concern.
*   **Safety Contributions:** None particularly stand out.
*   **Safety Detractions:** The narrowness of the street limits visibility. The alleyway could be isolated and potentially unsafe. The overall appearance suggests less maintenance.

Considering these points, Santiago (left) better reflects features associated with safety according to the given rules – well-lit areas (implied by daylight), clear pathways, some greenery, and maintained infrastructure.",1
