**Left Image Features & Safety Factors:**
*   **Street with Traffic:** There are cars visible on the street, indicating regular traffic flow and pedestrian crossings.
*   **Buildings & Businesses:** The presence of buildings and businesses suggests a populated area with potential for emergency services and residents. 
*   **Trees & Sidewalks:** Trees provide shade and visual interest, while sidewalks indicate pedestrian access and safety.
*   **Streetlights:** Streetlights contribute to visibility at night.

These features collectively suggest an active, well-maintained street environment where people are likely to feel safer due to increased visibility, potential for assistance, and a sense of community.

**Right Image Features & Safety Factors:**
*   **Large Open Area:** The image shows a vast, empty field with minimal landscaping. This creates a feeling of isolation and vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Buildings/Businesses:** There are no buildings or businesses in sight, which reduces the sense of security and potential for help if needed.
*   **Limited Visibility:** The open space makes it difficult to see what's beyond the immediate area, increasing the risk of encountering unexpected situations.
*   **Unpaved Road:** The unpaved road suggests a less maintained environment, further detracting from safety.

Overall, the right image conveys a sense of emptiness and potential danger due to its lack of human presence, limited visibility, and deteriorated infrastructure. It's simply not as reassuring or safe-feeling as the left image.",1

It has visible trees and greenery lining the street, suggesting a well-maintained environment. There are houses with yards, indicating residential activity.
