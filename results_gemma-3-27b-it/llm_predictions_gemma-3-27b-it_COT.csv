The presence of trees and greenery also contributes to a more welcoming and potentially safer environment. In contrast, the right side has heavier traffic, buildings closer to the road, and lacks a clearly defined pedestrian walkway, making it feel busier and potentially more dangerous.",1
96,50f5ecf1fdc9f065f0008b44,50f5eab0fdc9f065f0007c43,wealthier,left,15,1,left,"The left side appears wealthier due to several factors. The houses are larger and more well-maintained, suggesting higher property values. There's greenery and a sense of space, with neatly trimmed hedges and trees. The street itself is clean and paved. 

The right side shows signs of disrepair: graffiti on the wall, an unkempt landscape with overgrown vegetation, and a generally run-down appearance. This suggests lower property values and less investment in upkeep.",1
97,513e1a7efdc9f03587009212,513e5fbbfdc9f0358700b2af,more depressing,right,3,13,left,"The left side appears more depressing due to its starkness and lack of natural elements. The long, imposing brick wall creates a sense of confinement and isolation. The building is plain and utilitarian, lacking any aesthetic appeal. Shadows further contribute to the somber mood. In contrast, the right side features lush greenery, trees, and an open road suggesting access and freedom. The presence of nature evokes feelings of tranquility and positivity.",0
98,51422ccbfdc9f04926008b81,50f607dcbeb2fed6f800033d,safer,right,5,11,left,"The left side appears safer due to several factors. There are well-maintained houses, parked cars suggesting residential activity, and visible people on the street. These elements indicate a lived-in and potentially monitored neighborhood. The right side, in contrast, features an overgrown vacant lot, a large blank wall (potentially prone to graffiti or loitering), and a general sense of abandonment. This lack of upkeep and activity suggests a less safe environment.",0
99,50f448b5fdc9f065f0004234,5140cbbcfdc9f04926002c37,livelier,right,0,16,right,"The right side appears more lively due to several factors. It shows buildings close to the street, suggesting commercial activity and potential pedestrian traffic. There's a car and a motorcycle parked in front of the building, indicating recent use. The presence of awnings over storefronts suggests businesses are open or recently were. In contrast, the left side is dominated by an empty road with minimal visible activity – just a single van driving on it. The large green spaces while pleasant, don't convey the same sense of daily life and bustle as the right image.",1
