**Left Image Features:**
*   **Features:** Long, straight road with minimal activity. Sparse trees and mostly barren land alongside. Visible streetlights but they appear distant.
*   **Safety Contributions:** Streetlights offer some illumination.
*   **Safety Detractions:** Lack of pedestrians or visible life, the emptiness could feel isolating, and the lack of greenery makes it less inviting.

**Right Image Features:**
*   **Features:** More activity with parked cars and what appears to be a work crew. Trees provide some greenery. A clear pathway is defined by lane markings.
*   **Safety Contributions:** Visible activity suggests people are present, which can deter crime. Greenery adds a sense of care and community. Clear pathways indicate maintained infrastructure.
*   **Safety Detractions:** None immediately apparent.

**Applying the Rules:**

The right image aligns better with the safety indicators: visible activity (potential pedestrians/workers), clear pathways, and some greenery. The left image lacks these positive features and feels more isolated.",1
