There are visible pedestrians on the sidewalk, a clear pathway, greenery lining the street, and well-maintained infrastructure including streetlights. The lighting is adequate, and there’s no evidence of graffiti or damaged property. In contrast, the Amsterdam image (left) appears darker, with less pedestrian presence, and a more industrial setting with shadows obscuring details. While it has some greenery, the overall impression suggests a less safe environment due to lower visibility and a lack of clear human activity.",1

The lighting is noticeably darker and casts gray tones across the scene. There’s a sense of neglect with the somewhat worn pavement and trees, and the street appears relatively empty. While there are some buildings, they don't appear particularly vibrant or well-maintained, contributing to the overall feeling of subduedness. In contrast, the Sydney image has brighter lighting, more activity (a car is visible), and a generally more lively appearance, making it less depressing.",0

Specifically, the buildings appear newer and more well-maintained (though not exceptionally modern), there are no visible signs of disrepair or trash, and the overall landscaping is tidy. The road surface is smooth and appears recently paved. In contrast, the Amsterdam image shows an older canal path with some vegetation encroaching on the pavement, suggesting a less maintained area. While Amsterdam is undoubtedly a wealthy city, this particular street view doesn’t convey that same sense of prosperity as the Atlanta scene.",1
